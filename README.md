}
```

## Run the app
Firstly, clone the repo:\
    `git clone https://github.com/mareczek2115/json-verification-task`\
In the project directory, install project dependencies and TypeScript globally:\
    `npm install`\
    `npm install -g typescript`\
Afterward, compile the TypeScript file and then run the function and test the provided JSON.\
    `tsc main.ts`\
    `node main.js`\
If you want to change the input data, paste your JSON into `json/jsonToVerify.json` and run the `node main.js` command again.

## Unit test
A file with unit tests is also included, with multiple cases of JSON testing. You can run them with the following command:\
    `npm run test`.
